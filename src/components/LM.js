        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Footstep power is an exciting innovation that uses piezoelectric sensors to capture the mechanical energy from footsteps
          and convert it into usable electrical energy. Piezoelectricity, a property of certain materials, generates an electric charge 
          in response to applied mechanical stress. This technology has the potential to transform daily activities into sustainable energy sources.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          By embedding piezoelectric sensors into floors of high-traffic areas like public transit hubs, stadiums, and office buildings, 
          we can create renewable energy solutions. These systems are designed to store and redistribute energy efficiently, powering 
          lighting systems, charging stations, and even smaller devices. Such advancements can help us transition to a cleaner, 
          more sustainable future.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          As the technology advances, we may see more widespread adoption across industries and geographies. Combining this 
          with innovations in energy storage and distribution can unlock incredible opportunities for reducing our reliance 
          on non-renewable energy sources.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Join us in exploring how footstep power and other green technologies are shaping the future of energy sustainability. 
          Together, we can take steps, quite literally, toward a brighter and more sustainable future.
