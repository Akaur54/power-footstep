            What is PIEZOPACE?
          </h2>
          <p>
            PIEZOPACE leverages the mechanical energy produced by foot traffic and converts it into electrical energy using high-sensitivity piezoelectric materials. The system’s robust and scalable design ensures it can be seamlessly integrated into urban infrastructure. From bustling walkways to busy transit hubs, PIEZOPACE transforms ordinary foot traffic into a sustainable energy solution, making cities smarter and greener.
