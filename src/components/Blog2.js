            What Makes PIEZOPACE Unique?
          </h2>
          <p>
            PIEZOPACE introduces a novel way to generate energy by harnessing the mechanical force of foot traffic. Using advanced piezoelectric materials, the system efficiently converts this energy into electricity, offering a sustainable and scalable solution for urban spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            But PIEZOPACE is more than an energy system; it’s a movement toward integrating clean energy into everyday life. By embedding renewable technology into familiar settings, it transforms cities into living, breathing examples of sustainability.

            How It Works
          </h2>
          <p>
            When someone steps on a PIEZOPACE-integrated surface, the mechanical pressure activates piezoelectric materials that generate electricity. This energy can then be stored or used to power lights, sensors, or other urban systems. The system is designed to be durable, weather-resistant, and easy to maintain, making it perfect for high-traffic areas.

            A Vision for Greener Cities
          </h2>
          <p>
            PIEZOPACE is part of a broader vision to make cities smarter and more sustainable. By utilizing untapped energy sources like foot traffic, it provides a decentralized solution to urban energy needs. Beyond functionality, it also sparks conversations about sustainability, inviting communities to take part in creating a greener future.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            The Road Ahead
          </h2>
          <p>
            While the current focus is on generating energy from foot traffic, the future of PIEZOPACE could involve hybrid systems, integrating solar or wind energy for even greater efficiency. Enhanced storage solutions are also on the horizon, ensuring that every watt of energy is captured and utilized.
